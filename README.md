This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when working with arrays. The function `combine` intends to concatenate two number arrays. However, if either `arr1` or `arr2` happen to contain strings (due to dynamic input or unforeseen circumstances), the `concat` method will produce a `string[]`, leading to a type error. The solution involves type guarding to ensure both arrays contain only numbers.
